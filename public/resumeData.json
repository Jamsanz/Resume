    "bio": "Hi there! I am Muhammad! A software developer with experience in designing and developing software applications using React + Redux, Nextjs, Node, Typescript, MySQL, and NoSQL MongoDB (Mongoose), and so also, I have built and worked with Restful API(s). The amount of time I have spent in the current company I'm working for has taught me a lot about software development, best practices, and clean code writing. I was opportune to have worked with a team of fine software developers ranging from senior developers to junior developers like me. We have built sophisticated systems like Monitoring and evaluation systems, Application portals, and Administrative dashboards. I started as a javascript developer earlier this year (2021) but in the course of my journey, I am currently more comfortable writing typescript applications than javascript. I am a relentless competent team player with a lot of muscle for project delivery and success. I have a lot of passion for learning more and growing more. I am very passionate about building highly sophisticated systems that would change the world.",
